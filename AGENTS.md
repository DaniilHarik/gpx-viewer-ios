## Key files
- `SPEC.md` – Product requirements and UX scope.
- `README.md` – Architecture, setup, and user-facing docs.

## Non-negotiables
- When a feature is changed or added, always update `SPEC.md`.
- When a feature is removed, always update `SPEC.md`.

## Naming
- Use `ee.impero.gpxviewer` as bundle.

## Repo context
- iOS app project under `GPXViewer/` with tests in `GPXViewerTests/` and `GPXViewerUITests/`.
- Keep edits scoped to the workspace; avoid touching unrelated files.

## Verification
- If you change app behavior, mention relevant tests or Xcode run steps.
